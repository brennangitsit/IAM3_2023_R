# A Beginner's Guide to R: <br>Reproducible Data Analysis Using R and the Tidyverse
### June 12-17 at [IAM3 2023](), Stockholm, Sweden <br>Instructors: Brennan Terhune-Cotter and Dr. Matt Dye

## Welcome to the IAM3 2023 R Workshop!

## Objective
Scientists are increasingly required to make their data preparation, analysis, and statistics **reproducible**. :point_up: Reproducible resarch means anyone should be able to take your dataset and, using your analysis plan, arrive at exactly the same results as you did. That's good science! :raised_hands:

However, in the data analysis stage of a science project, preparing the data takes up 90% of the time. :scream: In this workshop, you will learn about how to do *reproducible* data preparation and analysis using [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com) and [the tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org). With these tools, you'll do better science :sunglasses:, save a lot of time :grin:, reduce errors :sweat_smile:, and even make some pretty graphs. :heart_eyes:

## Your Workspace
We're using [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) - a cloud-based version of RStudio that runs entirely within your browser. It's like Google Docs, but for R! No installation needed. :sunglasses:
You will have received an email with a link to the workshop's workspace on Posit Cloud. If you don't have the link, please [email](mailto:mwddls@rit.edu) or ask Matt. Materials for each day will be added on a rolling basis. 

**To set up your Posit Cloud workspace:**
1. Click the link in the Posit Cloud invite.
2. Set up your Posit Cloud account. 
3. Log in. Look at the "Spaces" on the left. Click on "IAM3 2023 R Workshop", if you're not there already
4. When in the workshop workspace, click on **New Project > New RStudio Project**.
5. Name your project at the top. This will be your playground for the workshop!
6. Throughout the workshop, we will ask you to download lab files from the IAM3 2023 R project and upload them to your own project. Here's how you do this:

## Acknowledgements
Dr. Adam Stone presented [an R workshop](https://github.com/foundinblank/2019-ntid-data-workshop) in March 2019 which Matt and Brennan attended. Dr. Stone gave us permission to reuse the materials from this workshop, which comprise much of the content in Days 1 and 4 of this workshop. We are grateful to him for getting us started on this journey and being willing to share his materials!

Hadley Wickham's book, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), has also been an invaluable resource in developing this workshop.

IAM3 is hosted by Stockholm University. Thanks to Krister Schönström and all others who helped make the Institute and this workshop happen!
