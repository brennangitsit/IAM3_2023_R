# R Markdown Files ----------------

This is an R Markdown document, which is used to create documents with executable code.

See <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> for details on R Markdown.

This is a code chunk, in **gray**. You can run the code in this chunk by pressing the green Play button on the right.

Every R Markdown document has a `setup` chunk in the beginning. The `include = FALSE` parameter tells it not to include this chunk in the final document.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# How to Run Code ----------------

Here, you will start running lines of code. 
There are a few ways you can run a line of code in an R script
Running a line of code = telling the computer to execute that line.

1. Highlight the line of code, and press Cmd-Enter (Mac) or Ctrl-Enter (Windows)
2. Put the cursor anywhere in the line of code, and press Cmd-Enter
3. Type the code into the Console (the box below), next to the ">" then press Enter. 

In R Markdown files, like this one, there is another way to run code:
 4. Press the green play button on the right to run all code within a chunk.


# Install the Tidyverse ----------------

Run this line of code. It will install a lot of stuff onto the machine.
You only have to do this once, ever, on any machine you're on.

RStudio is helpful - it will scan code and show a warning message if it sees any libraries that aren't installed yet. For now, press "Don't Show Again."
But if you already clicked "install," run this code anyway. 

Note that I included `eval = FALSE` as a parameter in this code chunk.
This is because I *do not* want this code to be run ("evaluated") when the document is created ("knitted") at the end.
However, you can still run this code manually.

```{r tidyverse, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Lots of things will happen in the Console below. 
You will see an output, "Attaching Packages" with 8 green checkmarks and then "Conflicts" with two red X's. 
That's normal! That means everything in the tidyverse installed correctly, and you are ready to launch.
When you see `>` that means it's finished and now it's waiting for you to do something. 



# Load the Tidyverse ----------------

Run this line of code. It loads the core Tidyverse packages.

library() is like checking out cookbook from the library, bringing it home, and saying, "Okay, now I'm ready to start using recipes in this book!"

You need to load packages each time you open R or change R projects. Ignore the conflicts for filter() and lag(), that's normal.

Check out the tidyverse cookbook from the library and bring it home to cook with!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



# Make Sure Tidyverse Is Loaded ----------------

Tidyverse comes with some datasets. To make sure Tidyverse was loaded correctly, let's try looking at a dataset. 

```{r}
starwars
```


You should see a print-out in the Console with the first 10 rows of Star Wars character data. Fun! 

Want to see it in its own tab in the Source window?

```{r}
View(starwars)
```

`View(dataset)` is an example of a command I usually type in the Console, because it is a one-time request I want to make.

In the `starwars` tab, try clicking on different column names to sort the table. 

Press the Filter button and try filtering various columns.

Some columns can't be filtered, like films, vehicles, and starships. 

Try dragging the "starwars" pane out of the entire browser to turn it into a separate window. 



# Import Game of Thrones Data ----------------

Let's try importing some data! We will import `got_mortality_data.csv` in the `data/` folder.
This is a dataset containing data about every character in *Game of Thrones* and if/how they die!

Because `got_mortality_data.csv` is in the `data` folder, I have to make sure R is looking in the right place.

```{r import_data}
got_data <- read_csv("data/got_mortality_data.csv")
```

You should now see an object in the Environment called got_data. 

Click on it to see the dataset in the Source!

# Import Your Data ----------------

You can also try importing your own data. 
If you want to import your own data in Posit Cloud, be sure to upload it first.

Edit the code below with your filename, and change the function to match what type of file your data is in.

```{r import_my_data}
# Edit this code with your file name and the right function
my_data <- read_csv("my_data_filename.csv")
```

If you want to clean the variable names in your own dataset, run the following code.
This uses the function `clean_names` in the package `janitor`.

```{r clean_names}
my_data <- clean_names(my_data)
```



# Getting Help ----------------

You can look up any function by running `?name_of_function_goes_here`
Let's try `View`. (Remember it?)

```{r}
?View
```


What does `mean` do?

```{r}
?mean
```



# Thatâ€™s It! ----------------

We'll do more fun stuff during the workshop.

You can look at the Files pane to see all the other files we're working with here. 

You can also look in the data/ folder to see all the datasets we may be working with. 
Many of them have been cleaned up for this workshop. 
You can see how we did that in scripts/data_cleaning.R.
